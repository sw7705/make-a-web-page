          HTML documents contain <em>text
          content</em> which describes "what you see" and
          <em>markup</em> which describes
          "how it looks". Reference type material could be documents, images, or videos.

        Webpage
    <div class="components">
        A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
        <p>
          Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
        </p>
        <p>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). </p>
        <p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up. </p>
        <p><b>Basic HTML Vocabulary</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.</li>
            <li>Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</li>
            <li>Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write "a href="www.udacity.com""</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Inline vs Block Elements</P>

        <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b>
          or <b>block</b>. Block elements form
          an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">
        DOM
    <div class="components">
      <p><b>Document Object Model</b></p>
        <p>The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
          elements can have other elements inside of them.</p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
          of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
          inside of boxes, and so on...
        </p>
        <p>Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.</p>
        <p>
          When you read an HTML document as
          <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
          changing indentations going up and down the left side
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

        Text Editors for Programming
   <div class="components">
        <p>
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors
          (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the
          programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors
          will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you
          write an opening tag.

          Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetition, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
